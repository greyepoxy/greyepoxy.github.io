Hi! I am a programmer from the pacific northwest. Since graduating as a Computer engineer in 2012 I have had the great pleasure in designing  silicon chips, programming microcontrollers, building games, working on applications, web programming and almost everything in between.

### More Information

This blog will be mostly about my experiences with web programming but I might touch other topics as well.
