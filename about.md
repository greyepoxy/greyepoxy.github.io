Hi there, thanks for checking out my blog! I am an avid programmer and lifelong learner from the pacific northwest. Since graduating as a Computer Engineer in 2012 I have spent time designing silicon chips, programming microcontrollers, coding video games, working on consumer applications, and writing web apps.

### Why this blog?

When working I find that I enjoy experimenting with new approaches and ways of thinking. This blog is intended to be a collection of narratives describing the different experiments that I have tried and how they influenced my thinking. I will also mix in some how-to articles about specific techniques and solutions that I struggled to develop.
