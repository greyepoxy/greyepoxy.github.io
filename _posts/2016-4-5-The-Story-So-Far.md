title: The Story So Far
---

For the past two years I have spent a significant amount of time towards the goal of programming chess in the browser. The aim was to enable players to play against one another remotely. While I have gotten only part of the way to this goal what has actually happened is that I have learned a decent amount about different web programming approaches. Maybe one day I will have chess working completely, but considering that I am not actually a huge fan of chess (I know crazy considering I have spent hours of my free time programming it) I would rather move onwards to something else. So now that I have spoiled the ending, lets spoil it even further. Here is a screen shot of the current (maybe final) product.

No seriously this is it... so yeah, I spoiled the ending... quit now. No point in continuing.

If I had been a smarter man I might have taken some screen shots throughout the process to better show off the stepping-stones, but (un)fortunately I am not. Most of the stepping-stones are blocks of code anyway, which lives on in source control forever. In a follow-up post I will have some more screen shots showing off the game in action (instead of one that looks like it was ripped from [google](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=svg+chess+board)). With the power of github pages I plan on also linking to some live demos.

## Path to today ##
So here is a summary of the path that I took to get to the product above.

1. Started coding the game platform in Typescript (since JavaScript of course is for suckers) using Visual Studio 2013. Decided to use this as an opportunity to really learn TDD (test driven development) and how to write vertical features, so started writing the tests first and scoping the work to try to always deliver the next piece of value to the player at regular intervals. This helped maintain my sanity and kept the forward momentum going for quite a long time.
1. Struggled with Typescript/JavaScript. Turns out when your writing Typescript the more you know about JavaScript the better. Spent a lot of time refactoring my code to continually get to a better place.
1. Throughout this process struggled with Visual Studio's support for Typescript before finally deciding it was time to learn [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). What finally pushed me was (as usual) the promise of a better language. My brother linked me to [this article](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-ee6f3281e7f3) by Eric Elliot. While now I disagree with many of the things Eric has to say this was definitely the push I needed to look into alternative options. It was actually Eric's follow-up article on [functional programming](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-pt-2-functional-programming-a63aa53a41a4) which lead me to discover this great [FP intro book](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide). More on that later.
1. Node.js and the JavaScript community is crazy, so many things to learn and yet so little time... Wrote several github projects to ease learning. Investigated writing the game platform in pure JavaScript using Eric's stampit library. Decided that the lack of tooling (auto-complete and compile time checks) made it too annoying to work with. Just as a quick side note there are options here (like [Tern](http://ternjs.net/)) but I did not find one that served my purposes.
1. Moved the Typescript game platform and all the Chess logic over to a Node.js module build system. I use a set of [common gulp tasks](https://github.com/greyepoxy/common-gulp-tasks) to build each module ([check out an example](https://github.com/greyepoxy/common-gulp-tasks-recipe)). As a consequence of this move I split out several sections of code into their own modules. As follow up here, I have considered looking into using [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) instead of [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [browserify](http://browserify.org/). Currently this code is also stored in a private repository (not on github of course because who wants to spend money) so I would also like to publish all of this code in the near(ish) future.
1. The next step for chess was to actually build the website where users can sign in, create a new game, and make a move on an existing one. This is when I started to dig into learning the basics of webpack, [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/). While researching this, one of the many flux solutions [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and a JavaScript reactive solution [cycle.js](http://cycle.js.org/) both made mention of a compile to JavaScript language called [elm](http://elm-lang.org/).
1. Elm really drove home a lot of the functional programming and reactive concepts that I had been learning. I even decided that I liked elm so much that I decided to completely re-implement chess, all in elm! This lead to an energetic, exiting but ultimately disappointing relationship with elm. The current plan is to dig into elm further with a 'the good, the bad, and the ugly' follow up post (the screen shot above is actually from the elm implementation).

Some might say that this is 6 steps to many, but I like to argue itâ€™s probably still one step to few. I suspect that more than likely I am just making a big deal over nothing.

Thanks for reading, I hope to follow up with more specifics on the more interesting thought processes and discoveries.
