Hi readers! The idea of blogging is new to me so kind of nervous to see how this goes. My goal with this blog is to talk about some of my experiments with different web programming projects. Topics will most likely including javascript, typescript, gulp, webpack, browserify, react, redux, flux, elm, and likely others. Happy reading!
